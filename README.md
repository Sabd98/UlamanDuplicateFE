Task Answers: 
1. I place it to public in src directory, so it easy to called in NextJs. And make structure for every dummy data that i tried previously.
2. I'll use express js, node js, and Mongo DB. Because this is the backend that suits in my experience in Fullstack Career right now.
3. Pick a custom domain from vercel production
4. I'll add user file from my collection then install jsonwebtoken for user auth and bcrypt as password. Make user middleware. 
5. Caching and optimize images and videos.
6. With validation from frontend and prepare it to backend. In my ORM (Sequelize) or api validation applicate.
7. Lazy load and suspense i think.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
